									</section>
									<p>My most recent internship experience has been with Tesla. For 4 months, I worked as a team member on the Body in White Quality Engineering team on the Model Y. This team primarily works with the components of the structural body of the vehicles. </p>
									<p>On this team, I started off with analyzing Model Y customer data in order to identify the consumer’s pulse on the quality of the vehicle body. I created my own master spreadsheets to be able to automate the process of data visualization. I then would correlate this data with internal quality metrics using control charts, heat maps, box plots and pareto charts to be able to identify any quality trends our team can address. I presented the data by leading weekly meetings with the production engineering teams and body fitting teams to cross functionally address quality issues before they got to the consumer. </p>
									<p>Through this process, I actually identified several areas of improvement and created a data-backed presentation on methods of mitigation. I then elevated these concerns to upper management which prompted the immediate creation of a new team to address the issues.</p>
									<p>I also worked on several shop level concerns, working directly with process engineers on the factory floor to perform root cause analysis on internal quality concerns.</p>
									<p>Lastly, on Solidworks, I designed two assembly systems of multi-part fixtures to be able to more repeatedly and rapidly measure seal gap on both the Cybertruck and Model Y. For one of the fixtures, I ran a GR&R and was able to quantitatively validate an improvement in both reproducibility and repeatability along the length of the vehicle seal gap. </p>
									<p>Through this internship, I developed and practiced a deep appreciation of addressing mechanical issues from a data driven perspective. I also got the opportunity to be more hands-on with the products and learned what design considerations affect the mass production of a product.</p>

									<p>My longest and (so far) most rewarding internship experience has been with Apple. For 8 months I interned as a Product Design intern on the iPad Product Design team in Cupertino, California. Unfortunately, I cannot divulge too much into my projects! But here is a pre-approved blurb on my Apple journey:</p>
									<p>On this team, I owned and resolved several critical mechanical design build issues. I did this by first performing root cause analysis to understand why the build issue occurred. I then used the NX CAD software to redesign the modules and create prototype (DOE) designs that would address these issues. I used tools such as the Tolerance Stack Analysis to ensure there was no mechanical interference with the DOE designs. I created CAD drawings of each component within the DOE assemblies and used these to work closely with vendors to manufacture and assemble these DOE modules. I then developed standards of practice (SOPs) to record data on the component performance that closely resembled in unit conditions. I used these SOPs to evaluate the DOEs designs through key module performance metrics. I worked with my team to then down-select the final new redesigns and monitored the key risks through the implementation of the new component.</p>
									<p>In this internship, I was thrown into the rigorous and fast paced process of Product Design and was given the opportunity to be responsible for several components. I was able to learn and practice through crucial contributions, several design principles that are unique to a mass produced consumer tech device. I learned how to be nearly overly critical with designs and check every possible risk at each step of a module’s development. I frequently managed relationships with multiple material and component suppliers and learned to leverage resources from suppliers to be more efficient in the development of components. I also learned how to create perfectly curated presentations and one pagers that would ease cross functional communication on highly technical issues. Overall, I learned the most from this experience.									</p>

									<p> My favorite Product Design challenge has been my internship with Cala Health. Cala Health is a startup that researches, develops and manufactures neuromodulating consumer medical devices. Their most recently released product is a wrist-worn device that alleviates tremor symptoms for patients with Parkinson’s disease and Essential Tremor. For 4 months I interned as an R&D Mechanical Engineering intern on both the Cala kIQ Team and New Product Development team.</p>

									<p>On the Cala kIQ team, I started off by designing, prototyping and manufacturing a subcomponent assembly fixture for the Cala kIQ that significantly increased the assembly process’s precision and speed by 4 times.</p>
									<p>For the most part of my internship however, I was on the New Product Development team. This team worked on the R&D of a new wearable neuromodulating device. For this product, I developed bench testing and user testing protocols to characterize the electromechanical properties of several electrode materials. Following the performance of both trials, I analyzed the results and was able to identify a major mechanical design conflict on the device. In order to mitigate this design issue, I redesigned several different versions of the “problem” module, using the Solidworks CAD software. I then manufactured the prototyped solutions for evaluation and performed user testing of the prototyped devices to evaluate their performance. I presented the results of 2 viable prototypes to the rest of the team, one of which has a pending patent.</p>
									<p>At Cala, as it was a startup, I earned a lot of responsibility as an intern. I had the opportunity to pick up many different roles of product design and development. I loved working with the company’s scientists and engineers to root cause design issues and really enjoyed the freedom of design exploration that comes with the early stages of product creation. What made the engineering design challenge most interesting to me was how closely this device interfaced with the user. There are many design principles unique to wearables that require a re-structuring of the design engineer’s approach to solving a mechanical solution. Here, I had the privilege of learning why each principle was so important through first hand experiences.</p>

									<p>My first internship was at Johnson & Johnson’s minimally invasive medical device sector, Ethicon Endo-surgery. For 8 months I interned as an R&D Engineering Design intern on a New Product Development Team and a Cost-Savings Team.</p>

									<p>For the first 4 months of my internship I interned with the Cost-Saving Team. On this team, I created testing protocols to validate product material, tooling and design changes. I analyzed the result from these trials and worked with vendors to address any quality issues affecting the deviated designs. I also assisted in project management of plastic and packaging vendors by managing quotes to create the team’s budget and implementing project timelines.</p>
									<p>For the second portion of my internship, I interned under the New Product Development Team. I wanted to more directly impact the design of a medical device through a team in the earlier stages of an unreleased device. On this team I analyzed surgeon user trials to identify key points of user error prototype devices and used this data to down-select the product’s button design. I also lead the effort to redesign an electromechanical component on a laparoscopic energy device. I led the team through a brainstorming process and used concept selection tools to identify a series of prototyped solutions. I then created and executed testing protocols in a tissue lab and analyzed the data from these tests. I presented the results from these studies to the rest of the team in order to down-select future solutions.</p>
									<p>I also worked with the Hispanic Employee Resource group to found and lead a Spanish language and Latin culture program that held weekly sessions to better facilitate communication between our international partners.</p>
									<p>Johnson & Johnson was my first corporate experience and was my first introduction to how products were designed. It was here that I first developed an interest in the product design space between the user and the device.</p>
